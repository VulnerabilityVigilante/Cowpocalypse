    introLines:
    - "You're back just in time, partner. The animals have been acting strange lately
      \u2014 restless at night, pacing the fence line..."
    - "Every morning I find more boards torn loose, like something big leaned against
      them\u2026 or tried to climb over."
    - "I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s the wind, or if they\u2019re being spooked
      by something out there in the dark."
    - "If you\u2019ve got the hands for it, I need that fence mended before we lose
      the whole herd."
    activeLines:
    - "The animals were uneasy again last night. You feel that chill in the air?
      Something\u2019s not right."
    - "I keep hearing the posts creak after midnight, like something\u2019s pushing
      on them\u2026 slow and heavy."
    - "Stay sharp out there while you\u2019re working. If you hear breathing \u2014
      don\u2019t look toward the trees."
    completeLines:
    - "You fixed it, then? That\u2019s a relief\u2026 though I could swear the air\u2019s
      heavier now that it\u2019s done."
    - "Funny thing \u2014 the animals are quiet tonight. Too quiet."
    - "If you see anything out there beyond the fence line, don\u2019t try to be
      a hero. Just come running."
  allQuestsCompleteLines:
  - "You\u2019ve done everything I asked, and the ranch looks whole again\u2026 but
    some nights I still hear them."
  - "It\u2019s not the animals. It\u2019s deeper than that. The kind of sound you
    feel in your ribs."
  - "Keep your eyes open out there, partner. Fences don\u2019t stop what comes crawling
    under."
